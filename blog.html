                <p>Today should have been a great day. A joyous occasion for the books! Today,
                    I should have been welcoming my 5th child into the world. I can imagine, the 
                    room would have been filled with blue balloons, teddy-bears, and a line of
                    family members excited to hold our new additions. 
                </p>
                <p>Our seven-year old daughter would be glowing, ecstatic that her prayers 
                    had finally come true. She would shower her new brother with kisses and talk of 
                    all the things she couldn't wait to teach him.

            <h3>Everything Changes</h3>
           
                <p>I knew something was wrong. I had been telling my doctors for two weeks
                    that something wasn't right. No one would listen. But on Monday morning, 
                    our lives changed forever. That morning, I was rushed into surgery where
                    due to a ruptured ecoptic pregnancy. 

                </p>
                <p>On February 11, 2019, we lost our 5th child and our world forever changed and our 
                    amazing 7-yr old, who just hours before had been ecstatic, was now devastated
                    that she would not be a big sister.

            <h3>The Months That Followed</h3> 
                <p>The days, weeks, and months that followed were some of the darkest times 
                    of my life. Depression set in and I buried myself beneath a heap of 
                    blankets and made the sofa my permanent home. I cried daily. I couldn't work, take care of
                    my house, or run the business I had worked so hard to build.
                </p>
                <p>Depression was taking its toll. I began losing my hair. I began having PVCs (premature ventricular contractions - extra heartbeats that disrupt a regular rhythm.)
                    After several tests, my cardiologist discover a pericardial effusion (the buildup of fluid around the heart.)
                    In short, I was grieving myself to death. Literally.

            <h3>Coding Saved My Life</h3> 
                <p>One day, while playing Candy Crush, my husband came across an advertisement
                    for the Full Stack Web Development program at Lambda. My husband knew I had always
                    had a desire to learn to code and knew Lambda could bring me back from the dead.
                </p>
                <p>He insisted I apply for the program. He pushed, demanded, and finally picked me up
                    off the couch and set me at the computer to fill out the application.
                </p>
               
                <p>Long story short, I was accepted into Lambda. My life
                    had focus and purpose again. Where depression and grief had once occupied 
                    every thought, Lambda replaced it with a challenge and a new focus.
                </p>
                <p>Three months into Lambda, I have a clean bill of health from my cardiologist. My hair 
                    is slowly returning. I have hope. But had I not found Lambda, had I not started the challenging
                    program and a become part of a community of support and encouragement, according to my
                    cardiologist, I would not be here today.
